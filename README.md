# Project Overview

I completed this project as part of CS 290 (Web Development) during Winter 2019 while I was a student at Oregon State University. **The instructor for that class has granted me express permission to post the source code I submitted for this project publicly for use in my professional portfolio.**

The project assignment required creating a simple website and deploying it publicly. We had not learned backend development yet, so I simply used HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript when completing this assignment. 

The website is called the Church Accessibility Project. Both physical accessibility and digital accessibility are important to me, and I am a Christian, so the website gives advice to churches on physical and digital accessibility. While I created this website to fulfill a course requirement, I enjoyed creating a website on something about which I am passionate.

This website is currently hosted on Oregon State's Engineering server because that is where I posted it publicly for free while a student at Oregon State. It can be accessed at:
