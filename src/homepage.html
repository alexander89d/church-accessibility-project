            <h2>Church Accessibility Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>This website is a tool to help churches become more accessible to people with disabilities. Whether you are a church leader, a person with a disability, or someone who just wants more information about how to best accommodate people with disabilities, you are encouraged to browse the available resources in the menu on the left.</p>
            <p id="BibleQuote">"As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. And his disciples asked him, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?' Jesus answered, 'It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.'"
            <br>
            <em>John 9:1-3, ESV*</em>
            </p>
            <h2>About the Website Developer</h2>
            <p>My name is Alex Densmore, and I am legally blind. I am a Christian, so church is a vital part of my life. My faith in God helps me through my day-to-day life, and I want all people with disabilities to feel welcome in church. Often, people who have never been around someone with a disability do not know how to act. It can be hard for them to know what to say or what to do to accommodate the person with a disability. Those of us with disabilities want to be treated like everyone else. Do not be afraid to say hi to us and ask us how we are. Often the biggest barrier to someone feeling welcome in a church is when people are nervous about interacting with them and avoid it altogether. </p>
            <p>Certainly no one knows how to accommodate every type of disability perfectly. Even those with disabilities such as myself do not know what people with any given disability may need, let alone what every individual with the same disability as us need. When in doubt, always <em>ask a person how you can help them.</em> </p>
            <p>That being said, being informed of general best practices to make your church accessible will help your church be as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This website will give you a general overview of what you can do to make your church more accessible.</p>
